  <article class="post-content">
    <h1 id="year-1-objectives">Year 1 Objectives</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Demonstrate flutter suppression</li>
  <li>Demonstrate shape modification</li>
</ul>

<p>We will demonstrate flutter suppression in flight first, then add in the shape modification. We are not necessarily going to be minimizing drag with the modified shape, most likely just trying a different trim solution. For mAEWing2, we’ll need look at the flexibility and control surface layout needed to modify shapes in a manner that affects drag.</p>

<h1 id="ground-rules">Ground Rules</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Meetings
    <ul>
      <li>Initially monthly strategic meetings, then spread to quarterly</li>
      <li>Tactical meetings every few weeks</li>
      <li>Weekly or twice weekly status meetings</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Integrated Product Team, contact members directly (contact list added to website here)</li>
  <li>Website, paaw.net
    <ul>
      <li>Lot’s of models, control laws, etc for configuration control</li>
      <li>Plan to use designations and website to help keep everything in sync (i.e. ensure that the flight software is in sync with the control laws, which are using the correct models and physical aircraft measurements)</li>
      <li>git repositories for each component to aid with configuration control</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Units
    <ul>
      <li>NASA will require Imperial units</li>
      <li>We’ll have signal and naming conventions with clearly defined interfaces specifying units</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="tactical-discussion">Tactical Discussion</h1>
<ul>
  <li>How many control surfaces and how flexible should mAEWing1 have?
    <ul>
      <li>We will need to create new wing for flight test (mAEWing1), the question is how many control surfaces the wing should have and how much flexibility. Decreased flexibility, compared with BFF or X-56, could ease the control law development; however, we already have models for those vehicles allowing development to start right away. Increased number of control surfaces on mAEWing1 would potentially reduce risk for the mAEWing2 design, where we may need more surfaces for the conformal mold line, but would increase complexity for the first year testing. After much discussion, we decided that we would baseline the mAEWing1 on a scaled down X-56, assuming that the X-56 models are readily available. This is due to the potential availability of an FEM model of the X-56, which is not available for the BFF and to minimize work needed to complete mAEWing1. Wing flexibility and the number and type of control surfaces will be left open as design variables for mAEWing2.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="actions">Actions</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Check on availability of X-56A models</li>
  <li>Send doodle polls to find recurring meeting times</li>
  <li>Start getting preliminary data to the team to start working on models, control laws, MDAO</li>
  <li>UMN to define signal names and interfaces</li>
</ul>
